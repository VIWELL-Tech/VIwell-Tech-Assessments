Task: Create a scalable multi-tenant SaaS backend using NestJS, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Jest for testing, and Docker for containerization. 

Requirements: 

Multi-Tenancy: 

Implement a strategy (e.g., subdomains, separate schemas) for multi-tenancy in PostgreSQL. 

Ensure data isolation and security between tenants. 

GraphQL API: 

Design GraphQL schema supporting CRUD operations for entities (e.g., User, Organization) per tenant. 

Implement authorization and access control based on user roles. 

Testing and Quality: 

Write Jest tests for GraphQL resolvers, ensuring tenant-specific functionalities and edge cases are covered. 

Containerization and Deployment: 

Dockerize the application and provide clear instructions for deploying multiple tenant instances securely. 

Deliverables: 

NestJS codebase with a multi-tenant GraphQL API and PostgreSQL integration. 

Documentation explaining multi-tenancy, security measures, and deployment. 

Jest test suite covering critical functionalities and tenant-specific scenarios. 

Docker configuration files and deployment guidelines for multiple tenant instances. 

Bonus (Optional): 

Implement GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates. 

Optimize database queries for improved performance considering tenant-specific data access. 

Submission Guidelines: 

Share a GitHub repository with code, documentation, and setup instructions in a README file.
