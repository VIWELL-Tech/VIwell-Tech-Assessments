# Coding task for Web Automation Engineer

## The Goal:
Your task is to write automated tests preferably with [Cypress](https://cypress.io) to demonstrate your test automation abilities.

## Task Description:
You are provided with a web application called "[Automation Exercise](https://automationexercise.com/)". This online store allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. Your task is to automate the testing of critical functionalities using Cypress, ensuring robustness, reliability, and efficiency of the test suite.

## Requirements:

### Test Scenarios:
- **User Authentication:**
  - Automate the login functionality ensuring successful authentication with valid credentials.
  - Test invalid login scenarios, such as incorrect username or password, and verify appropriate error messages.
  
- **Product Browsing:**
  - Automate the process of browsing products across different categories.
  - Verify that the product details are displayed correctly on the product page.

- **Cart Management:**
  - Automate adding products to the cart and verify successful addition.
  - Test the removal of items from the cart and verify the updated cart contents.

- **Checkout Process:**
  - Automate the checkout process, including filling in shipping details, selecting payment methods, and completing the purchase.
  - Verify the successful completion of the order and receipt generation.

### Advanced Requirements:
  
- **Data-Driven Testing:**
  - Utilize fixtures or external data sources to perform data-driven testing for login credentials and product details.
  
- **Custom Commands:**
  - Implement custom Cypress commands to encapsulate repetitive actions or assertions.
  
- **Cross-Browser Testing:**
  - Extend your test suite to run across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox) using Cypress plugins or configurations.
  
- **Parallel Execution:**
  - Configure Cypress to execute tests in parallel to improve testing efficiency.

### Reporting:
- Generate detailed test reports with clear descriptions of test results, including any failures or errors encountered during execution.

### Documentation:
- Provide documentation outlining the test strategy, including test coverage, approach to handling advanced requirements, and any limitations or considerations.

### Submission:
- Create a public repo on Github and push your code on it. then share the link back with us.
- Include any necessary setup instructions or dependencies in the repository's README file.
- Submit your solution along with the documentation to the provided email address by [48 hours].

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Completion of basic test scenarios.
- Correct implementation of advanced requirements.
- Efficiency and robustness of test scripts.
- Clarity and completeness of documentation.
- Adherence to best practices in test automation.
