Objective: Develop a GitHub repository search application that allows users to find repositories based on specific criteria using the GitHub GraphQL API, incorporating test coverage.

Requirements:

Homepage/Search Page:

Implement a search bar allowing users to search for GitHub repositories based on keywords, language, stars, or any other relevant criteria using queries to the GitHub GraphQL API.

Display search results dynamically as the user types or on search submission.

Repository Details Page:

Fetch and display detailed information about a selected repository, such as repository name, description, stars, forks, owner details, etc., using queries to the GitHub GraphQL API.

Show additional details that might be relevant and interesting for users.

Test Coverage:

Write test cases using a testing library/framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) to cover critical parts of the application, including components, GraphQL queries, and utility functions.

Ensure test coverage for search functionality, rendering components, handling API responses, and other relevant areas.

Styling:

Implement styling using Vanilla CSS, Sass, Styled Components, or any CSS-in-JS method to ensure a visually appealing and responsive UI.

Notes:

Utilize GitHub's GraphQL API for repository search and fetching details.

Use TypeScript for type safety if possible.

Handle potential errors gracefully, such as failed API requests or empty data.

Maintain code readability, structure, and adhere to best practices.

Focus on effective use of GraphQL queries to interact with the GitHub API.

Aim for comprehensive test coverage to ensure code reliability and robustness.

Evaluation Criteria:

Correct implementation of GraphQL queries to search for repositories and fetch repository details from the GitHub GraphQL API.

Functionality and correctness of the repository search feature and displaying repository details.

Code quality, readability, structure, and adherence to best practices.

Comprehensive test coverage for critical parts of the application, including components, API interactions, and utility functions.

Proper handling of state management, API interactions, and error scenarios using GraphQL.

Attention to basic UI/UX details for a smooth user experience.

Submission:

Provide a GitHub repository link containing the source code.

Include clear instructions for setting up, running the application locally, and executing the tests.
